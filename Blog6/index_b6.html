		<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
			giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average
			density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.Saturn is named after
			the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek
			Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for
			Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the
			cross added at the top in the 16th century.</p>
		<p>Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its
			core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid
			helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper
			atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's
			planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of
			Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The
			outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind
			speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on
			Neptune.</p>
		<p>The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with
			a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are
			officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and
			the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the
			only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>
		<h2>Habitability</h2>
		<p>There may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the
			planet Mercury may have been habitable, and perhaps that life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms,
			may have existed on the planet.</p>
