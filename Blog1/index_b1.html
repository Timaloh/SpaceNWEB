		<p><b>Mercury</b> is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
			takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
			(Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the
			Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and
			its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the
			planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in
			twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe
			than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and
			the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p>
		<p>Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
			spin–orbit resonance,meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for
			every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with
			the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would
			therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.</p>
		<p>Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its orbital
			eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance from
			the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily
			cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for
			billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally
			more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427
			°C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C;
			−136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.</p>
		<h2>Habitability</h2>
		<p>There may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the
			planet Mercury may have been habitable, and perhaps that life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms,
			may have existed on the planet.</p>
