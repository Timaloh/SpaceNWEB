		<p><b>Venus</b> is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
			brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
			occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a
			synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it
			takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite
			direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Venus does not have any
			moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.</p>
		<p>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size,
			mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It
			has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The
			atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the
			pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the
			hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is
			shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being
			seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as
			the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the free
			hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic
			field. As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long
			as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for
			writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions
			plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.</p>
		<h2>Habitability</h2>
		<p>Speculation on the possibility of life on Venus's surface decreased significantly after the early 1960s when it
			became clear that the conditions are extreme compared to those on Earth. Venus's extreme temperature and
			atmospheric pressure make water-based life as currently known unlikely.</p>
