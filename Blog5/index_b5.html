		<p><b>Jupiter</b> is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a
			mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly
			less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's
			night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman
			god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.</p>
		<p>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its
			volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a
			well-defined solid surface. The on-going contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount
			received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has
			a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands
			at different latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of
			this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century, when
			it was first seen by telescope.</p>
		<p>Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is
			nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and
			possibly many more, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede,
			the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.</p>
		<p>Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December
			1973. Jupiter has since been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the
			Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at
			Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to
			increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto.</p>
		<h2>Habitability</h2>
		<p>There is no life on the planet. But perhaps there are organisms that can withstand such a low temperature. So
			we are not completely sure that there are no living beings there.</p>
