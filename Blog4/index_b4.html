		<p><b>Mars</b> is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger
			than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the
			"Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a
			reddish appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars
			is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the
			Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>
		<p>The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the
			rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest
			volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the
			largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the
			planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and
			irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.</p>
		<p>Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars;
			launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. Mariner 4
			detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images
			of another planet from deep space. The Soviet Mars 3 mission included a lander, which achieved a soft landing
			in December 1971; however, contact was lost seconds after touchdown. On 20 July 1976, Viking 1 performed the
			first successful landing on the Martian surface.</p>
		<h2>Habitability</h2>
		<p>The current understanding of planetary habitability – the ability of a world to develop environmental
			conditions favorable to the emergence of life – favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most
			often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just
			beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's
			thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The
			past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability.</p>
