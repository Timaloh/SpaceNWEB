		<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who,
			according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and
			father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the
			Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which
			differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus
			and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to
			Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as
			water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere
			in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud
			structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The
			interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</p>
		<p>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system
			has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar
			orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images
			from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or
			storms associated with the other giant planets. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560
			mph).</p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Like the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by
			ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March
			1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first
			time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.</p>
		<h2>Habitability</h2>
		<p>The existence of an organism on this planet is unlikely. But it is still possible that there are organisms that
			can withstand such a temperature</p>
